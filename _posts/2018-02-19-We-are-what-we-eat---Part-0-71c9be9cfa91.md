#### The Point:

1. To put on paper connections that I’ve drawn, from multiple sources, on how the body treats and reacts to food

2. Draw practical conclusions from these connections

3. Potentially raise more questions that I need to find answers for in order to gain a more wholesome understanding of how our body treats food, and

4. To build mental models and develop systems around the knowledge I’ve gained so as to live a healthy and happy life

#### Disclaimers:

I’m not really sure why I’m writing this part up. But these days I believe I am also responsible for how people interpret my writings. So:

Disclaimer 1: I haven’t studied biology/biochemistry/physiology at any level that matters. My insights here are based on books, articles, podcasts written/presented by more knowledgeable people than myself.

Disclaimer 2: Any conclusions I come to are a result of (hopefully) sound logic and anecdotal evidence. What I’ve written here may or may not apply to the reader. If there’s anything I’ve learned, it is that no two bodies are alike.

#### Sources:

I’ll also list my sources up front and try to reference them whenever I draw a conclusion. By “sources” I mean “where I encountered these ideas first”, and not “who had the idea first”. Essentially this is a list of what I have read, heard, or am currently reading that will back some of the contents in my posts.

#### Introduction

There are multiple reasons why I started scratching the surface of this food topic, chief among which is that I’m trying to live healthier and get fitter. To this end, as I’ve mentioned in “The Point” of this story, I need to understand how the body treats food. Could I think about this less, and just adhere to some diet that a nutritionist tells me is good? Sure, but in real life when I’m in situations where I can’t follow the diet (or my resolve weakens), how do I know what food to choose? Plus, biology is awesome!

Now, onto what I’m going to write about:

I still haven’t gotten a full picture (and neither have nutrition scientists, apparently), or even half a picture, to be honest. But I’ve started to gain some insight into how and why what we eat affects our weight, our energy levels, our immunity, our mood, behavior, and brain activity. The sages were right: we truly are what we eat!

We are also, unsurprisingly, addicted to types of food that are very bad for us (viz. sugar and cheese), but which are used and marketed so heavily that they’re almost unavoidable in the West or in any community that has learned from the West. And these aren’t just my words. Most of the sources I’ve listed above explicitly mention that there is a trend of increased sickness and disease in communities that have embraced modern Western dietary habits. Rather unfortunately I’ve been a victim of these habits myself. I also see these modern Western dietary foods becoming part of the normal diet in my hometown of Chennai, India, and it saddens me so much.

I intend on highlighting the fitness and health related takeaways I’ve gotten. I think I’ll start my posts at a more macroscopic level and then work my way towards the microscopic level. In other words, I’ll start with my understanding of how muscles operate, the body’s energy systems, and what it means to get fitter through exercise. This ought to provide a neat segue into talking about foods that are good for us and bad for us. This should lead us to how the body processes this food and all the other effects on the body this has, eventually bringing us to the question of “what next?”.

Stay tuned!
