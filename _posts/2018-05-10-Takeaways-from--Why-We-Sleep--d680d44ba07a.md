# Takeaways from “Why We Sleep”

I’ve been guilty of saying “Sleep? I can sleep when I’m dead” on many occasions. Often it was the first thing I’d be willing to compromise on in order to fit in more activities. College. Grad school. Work. It was sleep, after all. We can always catch up later. It was among the bottom of my priority list.

Shouldn’t have done that. I messed up. The crystal ball of hindsight now makes me wonder what could’ve been. Damn you, Dr. Matthew Walker.

Although I do have chapter-wise notes like I took for “[The Cheese Trap](https://medium.com/klein-bottle-shaped-rocks/notes-from-the-cheese-trap-b31101be0041)”, the notes for each chapter is about 500+ words. Plus, I don’t think I want to ruin the “what the f\*\*k” and “holy shit” moments you’ll get from reading about the history, science, experiments, and results in the book. So I won’t be pasting those notes over here.

However, I do want to write about the content that really intrigued me, and highlight some things that are pertinent to me and to people that I know. The hope is that, with this understanding of sleep (aka mental models), we can make changes to our lifestyle to prioritize and get the most out of sleep.

Do yourselves a favour, and read this book. You’ll be better for it. Here — click this [link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZZ1YGJ5/ref%3Ddp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).

One of the most enlightening books I’ve read. [Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZZ1YGJ5/ref%3Ddp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) to buy

Before I start, I would like to make a disclaimer that since I’m not familiar with the brain and it’s workings, some of my inferences/paraphrasing may be incorrect. Apologies if that is the case.

### How We Fall Asleep

Sleep is a function of two things in the body: your circadian rhythm, and your sleep pressure.

Your circadian rhythm, which is governed by a bunch of neurons in the brain called the Suprachiasmatic nucleus, is a steady rhythm having a period of a little of 24 hours on average which signals to your body that it is time to sleep. It achieves this by secreting melatonin at certain times of the day (after sunset).

Sleep pressure is in the form of a hormone called Adenosine which binds with receptors in the brain (and is cleared out by the liver during sleep) which actually makes you sleep.

The circadian rhythm and sleep pressure work independent of each other. The circadian rhythm keeps chugging away at it’s normal frequency. Sleep pressure steadily rises over the course the day, and falls steeply over the period of our sleep. When the circadian rhythm’s sleep drive and the sleep pressure are both near their peaks is when we tend to/should fall asleep.

#### What caffeine does

Interestingly, caffeine binds with the receptors in the brain that Adenosine is supposed to, and that’s why it helps keep you up. But there’s still built up Adenosine, which continues building up, so the more you push sleep away, the harder you’ll crash when you do sleep.

#### As we fall asleep…

The brain signals a slow down in heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure. The core body temperature drops a little. These are essential to be able to sleep. The brain stem and Thalamus (our ‘sensory gate’) stop feeding sensory information to the other parts of the brain (not completely though).

---

### During Sleep

There are 3 phases of sleep that effectively “battle” for dominance in roughly 1.5 hour cycles. Light NREM (Stages 1 and 2 NREM). Deep NREM (Stages 3 and 4 NREM). REM.

REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement (which is what happens to our eyes as we enter that phase of sleep). NREM is Non-REM.

As the Thalamus blocks the sensory information, we fall into Light NREM sleep, and then afterwards slip into deep NREM. Our brainwaves during NREM are sinusoidal and predictable, with pulses starting in the middle of the frontal lobes and pulsing all the way to the back of the brain. Occasionally, there are “sleep spindles” that are observed during the downbeat in the NREM waves.

After deep NREM comes the chaos of REM. The Thalamus swings wide open, and our memories and emotions are played out in the theater of our brain — a phenomenon that we know as dreams. During REM, our body is actually paralyzed. This is why we don’t enact our dreams, even though during dreams the brain is throwing many motor instructions. The paralysis is signaled by a disabling signal that runs through the full length of the spinal cord from the brain stem.

Importantly, as mentioned initially, the distribution of these 3 phases are not equal during their 90 minute cycles. NREM is more dominant in each cycle during the first 5–6 hours of sleep, and REM is more dominant in the last 2–3 hours. So by cutting off sleep in the morning, for example, 70% of your REM cycles could be lost and you’ll be the worse for it.

Note: we do actually dream in NREM as well, but the vivid, chaotic, hallucinogenic dreams that we experience are during REM.

### Can you catch up on sleep?

Not really. Although you may feel reasonably refreshed after compensating for lost sleep, the toll that sleep deprivation has taken on your body can’t be undone.

### “I’ll only sleep if it helps \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_”

Each stage of sleep provides some unique but necessary type of nourishment to our brain and our body.

Here’s a list of all the things it helps with. Clicking the links will take you to the section where I’ve briefly described the facts and the science behind it:

* [Learning and Memorization](#35b1)
* [Muscle Memory](#11a1)
* [Creativity, Problem Solving, Abstraction](#0d61)
* [Get over trauma](#a00a)
* [Concentration](#63a3)
* [Emotional Quotient and Equanimity](#9fcf)
* [Offset Alzheimer’s](#b822)
* [Maintain/Improve Cardiovascular health](#2f65)
* [Offset diabetes, Obesity, Weight gain](#22b4)
* [Protect me from Cancer/Bolster Immunity](#9185)
* [Improve bedroom activities](#0bc2)
* [Keep my genes from misbehaving and keep me young](#8968)

#### Learning and Memorization

The facts:

* Sleeping/napping before sitting to study improved the ability to learn new facts.
* Sleeping after learning solidifies the information and improves memory retention.

How?

* Sleeping/napping before doing any learning helps because, during NREM, the brain clears the hippocampus (short-term memory storage) and makes it ready for accepting new information.
* Sleeping after learning solidifies information that you’ve learned, and transfers this information to the neocortex, which is a long-term memory storage site in the brain. The frontal lobe, which is the decision making center of the brain, also understands what’s important and what isn’t — thereby strengthening memories that need to be and helping forget those that aren’t.
* The memory transfer from hippocampus and cortex was enabled by the sleep spindles observed during NREM sleep; and for solidification of information learned, deep NREM sleep that happens earlier on in the night is more important than lighter NREM/REM that happens later on.
* The sleep spindles seemed to be loops of current between the hippocampus and the cortex, indicating that the memory transfer was happening.
* It was observed that in whomever more sleep spindles were observed, their learning was improved.
* Sleep spindles occurred during light NREM, but occurred more frequently in the later cycles of sleep sandwiched in between longer REM cycles. So ideally don’t cut short your sleep.
* Sleep spindles between the hippocampus and the frontal lobe are responsible for deciding what’s important and what isn’t. If you make a mental note to remember something, then chances are that during sleep that memory will be reinforced. Conversely if you make a mental note to forget something, chances are that it will be erased/diminished during sleep.

Note:

* If you lose out on sleep the very night after learning, your retention of what you learned diminishes. Catching up on the sleep later doesn’t help. So you \*have\* to sleep well the night after learning to retain it better.

So it would seem that a full night’s sleep is critical when it comes to learning and memorizing things.

#### Muscle Memory

The facts:

* When given a motor-oriented task that required practice, sleeping after practicing improved performance speed and quality.
* Example: typing, playing the piano, movements in sport etc.

How?

* Instead of transferring the memories from hippocampus to cortex, the transfer happened to brain circuits near the motor cortex that operated at a slightly subconscious level — leading to development of what we call “muscle memory”.
* It is once again the sleep spindles observed in Stage 2/Light NREM that seemed to loop through between the hippocampus to that area, and particularly sleep spindles that are observed during the last 2 hours of a full sleep that seem to enhance muscle memory.

Do note that sleep augments the process, but you’ll still need to practice mad hours to excel at it.

#### Creativity, Problem Solving, Abstraction

When we say creativity, it isn’t necessarily “artistic” in this context. It is also about problem solving abilities, the ability to obtain the gist of something you may have learned (abstract it away) so that you can apply the ideas to something completely different.

The facts:

* Sleep improves connectivity between different ideas in the brain to amazing effect. This is enhanced if you think/obsess about a certain problem or idea before you sleep.
* One draws random, but valid, associations between objects after sleep, moreso than when they’re awake (where the associations are more logical).
* Underlying patterns are also made more apparent after sleep (with sufficient REM cycles).
* “Sleeping on it” is the right answer.

How?

* Dreaming and REM sleep are where the magic happens.
* Not quite sure \*how\* the magic happens though. The studies that concluded the above weren’t as much about the brain chemistry than it was about associating the phases of sleep with our creative abilities.
* When in REM, the visuospatial regions in the back of the brain, the motor cortex, hippocampus and surrounding memory regions, and amygdala and cingulate cortex (emotional centers) are 30% more active than when we are awake.
* On top of that, the left and right sides of our prefrontal cortex, which manages our logical and rational thinking processes, are turned off. This could aid in the more fuzzy association between objects.
* Anecdotal evidence that dreams help creativity: Mendeleev’s periodic table came to him in a dream; Benzene ring came to Kekule in a dream; “Let it be” came to Paul McCartney in a dream.

Note:

* It’s easy to think that since memory regions are active during dreaming that dreams are a replay of our day. That is not the case. However, the emotions that we experienced during the day do get re-experienced during sleep.
* We also can dream about things that happened during the day (like a problem we’re trying to solve), and it is possible to control dreams (lucid dreaming).

#### Get over trauma

The facts:

* Sleep can act as therapy to help soothe memories of traumatic events (breakups, deaths, accidents etc). It can do this to greater effect if we dream about the traumatic event.

How?

* During sleep, the concentration of noradrenaline — a stress chemical in our brain associated with fight/flight responses — is low/zero. When traumatic memories are replayed in the brain, but in a relatively low-stress environment, the strong emotions associated with the events are stripped away. That is why this therapeutic effect is shown to be stronger for those who dream about the traumatic event.
* What about PTSD? For PTSD sufferers, noradrenaline concentrations remain high in the brain. It was discovered that a drug originally meant to reduce blood pressure, when given to PTSD patients, cured them of their PTSD as well. This was because it reduced concentration of noradrenaline in the brain in the night as well.

#### Concentration

The facts:

* You need to sleep to keep up your concentration level at it’s optimum. Even a single night of sleep deprivation can result in drastically reduced concentration levels.
* Sleeping 6 hours a night for 10 nights straight gives you the concentration level (on the 11th day) of someone who pulled an all-nighter . And this trend doesn’t plateau here. It just gets worse.
* Driving on just 4 hours of sleep is equal to driving at the point of being legally drunk.

How?

* The recycle rate of human beings is 16 hours. Meaning that after 16 hours of being awake, our brain begins to buckle.
* The brain tries to compensate for the lack of sleep by completely shutting out sensory information for small periods of time called ‘microsleeps’. So there are brief moments where we lose sense of what’s happening around us completely.
* The way they found that driving while sleepy is equal to driving drunk is by putting sleep deprived and drunk people behind the wheel of a virtual car in a virtual track and seeing how many mistakes they made.

#### Emotional Quotient and Equanimity

The facts:

* In terms of boosting your Emotional Quotient, a good night’s sleep means you will be able to distinguish subtle differences in emotional indicators of people — like degree of approachability — and place people on a scale of belligerent to happy quite accurately.
* Lack of sleep means you’ll have a generally negative outlook of the world, and perceive everyone negatively/cynically.
* In terms of equanimity, a full night’s sleep means you will be able to control your emotions and impulses better.

How?

* For EQ, I don’t think the science behind it is concrete, but something about REM sleep and dreaming enhanced our ability to read others better.
* For equanimity, it was found that under sleep deprivation, the amygdala (emotional center) showed 60% amplification in emotional reactivity — hence irritation when sleep deprived.
* The prefrontal cortex usually regulates the amygdala with some sort of inhibitory control when we’re well slept. With lack of sleep, the amygdala’s reactions are amplified \*and\* the prefrontal cortex’s regulation is lowered, so our responses are magnified.
* The Striatum, which is associated with impulsiveness and reward, also becomes hyperactive in a sleep deprived state. Typically this is also regulated by the prefrontal cortex, but loses it’s regulation when sleep deprived. This results in mood swings.

Note:

* There is a line of thought that sleep may have an influence on psychiatric disorders (like bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression), and not just vice versa. Following this thought process, people have been able to use sleep therapy to help improve symptom severity and even cause remission in patients with psychiatric disorders.

#### Offset Alzheimer’s

First, a little background on Alzheimer’s disease: It’s caused build-up of a protein in the brain called the beta-amyloid protein.

The facts:

* As we grow older, we lose the ability to generate powerful NREM brainwaves during sleep. With it, the risk of developing Alzheimer’s grows. But an early indicator of Alzheimer’s is disturbed/poor quality sleep or lack of sleep.
* Getting a full night’s sleep regularly can help delay onset of Alzheimer’s.

How?

* The beta-amyloid protein build-up starts in the middle part of the frontal lobe — which is the area where the powerful NREM brainwaves originate. Hence lack of deep sleep can be an early indicator for Alzheimer’s. As we know, lack of NREM sleep means our memory solidification processes weaken.
* There’s a “Glymphatic system” in the brain which cleans the brain of all the toxins generated by neural activity. The Glial cells of the brain shrink, and the Cerebro-Spinal Fluid comes in and cleans away these toxins — among which are the beta-amyloid deposits. This happens during deep NREM stages of sleep.

Note:

* On a positive note, they’ve found that stimulating deep NREM can restore memory consolidation, and in the future can even be a preventative measure for Alzheimer’s.

#### Maintain/Improve Cardiovascular health

The facts:

* Shorter sleep means increased risk of dying from Coronary Heart Disease. Findings replicated in another study that showed regularly getting < 6 hours of sleep meant you were 4–5 times more likely to suffer a heart attack.

How?

* Lack of sleep results in an overactive sympathetic nervous system. This means increased heart rate and more cortisol in the system (the hormone that delivers more energy to the muscles in fight/flight situations). This increases blood pressure, and gives our blood vessels a solid pounding. Over a period of time, conditions are ripe for rupturing blood vessels which cause heart attacks/strokes.
* During deep NREM, the body calms the sympathetic nervous system (and also releases the growth hormone). This is required for efficient repair of blood vessels.

Note:

* Quite astonishingly, in the US, where Daylights Savings time is followed and the clocks turn back/move forward an hour depending on whether it’s end of autumn/beginning of spring, they found that heart attacks rose 10% on the day or two following the switch where we lose an hour of sleep. Conversely, when we gained an hour of sleep, heart attacks reduced in the following days.

#### Offset diabetes, Obesity, Weight gain

The facts:

* Sleep deprivation can reduce your muscles’ blood sugar absorption efficiency by 40%, and was shown in biopsies of sleep deprived normally-healthy people.
* You also tend to eat more when sleep deprived, crave higher calorie foods, and are more impulsive in your choices. This results in weight gain.
* For those given a low calorie diet intended for weight loss, people who slept just 5–6 hours saw 70% of their weight loss come from muscle tissue, but those who slept 7–9 hours, 70% of the weight loss came from fat.

How?

* Inadequate sleep increases concentrations of Ghrelin (hormone that makes you hungry) and reduced concentrations of Leptin (hormone that reduces appetite), which means sleep deprivation makes you eat more. Sleeping regulates them, keeps them balanced and in check.
* Sleep loss increases amount of endocannabinoids (produced naturally by the body), which are the same chemicals that cause the munchies after weed usage.
* Due to lack of regulation from prefrontal cortex (again), our atavistic/hedonistic tendency to eat high calorie foods kicked in without much inhibition.
* The sympathetic nervous system being overactive due to the sleep deprived state meant the bad bacteria in the gut festered causing improper digestion and gastrointestinal problems.

#### Protect me from Cancer/Bolster Immunity

The facts:

* In 2007, WHO classified night shifts of work as “Probably Carcinogens”
* Lack of sleep has been associated with development of cancers of the breast, colon, uterus, and prostate.
* Sleep deprivation also causes quicker metastasis of cancers.

How?

* The body has natural cancer killing cells called M1 macrophages, which bite a hole in cancerous cells and inject a protein in them to kill them. Just one night of 4 hours of sleep can sweep away 70% of our M1 cells.
* Sympathetic nervous system kicking into overdrive provides an inflammatory response from our immune system. Cancer cells use this to help grow the blood vessels that feed the tumour mass. The tumour can further mutate the DNA of the cancer cells and increase their potency.
* Sleep deprivation not only reduces M1 macrophage concentration but boosts levels of M2 cells which promote cancer.

#### Improve bedroom activities

The facts:

* Limiting men to 5 hours of sleep results in drop in testosterone level
* Limited sleep means reduced sperm count and testicle size
* In women, follicular-releasing hormone drops if you regularly sleep less than 6 hours.
* Menstrual cycle abnormalities arise.
* Fertility is reduced for both genders, as well as perceived attractiveness.

How?

* This appears to be more of an association of data points. I’m not sure of the chemistry as such.

#### Keep my genes from misbehaving and keep me young

The facts:

* One night of reduced sleep modified the expression of genes in people such that it increased expression of genes involved in inflammation, cellular stress, and others that result in cardiovascular diseases. It reduced expression in those that regulated metabolism, cholesterol, and immune responses.
* HDL levels drop after poor sleep
* Body tends to age quicker due to chronic lack of sleep

How?

* It was found in a study that, when they slept for 6 hours instead of a full 8, expressions of 711 genes in a person were modified. Some were under-expressions and some were over-expressions, as mentioned above.
* Chromosomes have protective caps called Telomeres which help keep the DNA bound tightly together. If telomeres are damanged, then it results in improper genetic functioning. The telomere damage observed in sleep deprived people is similar to that observed in older people, and the consequent condition of the body of sleep deprived people is similar to that of older people as well.

“Alright. I get it”, you say.

### “What do I do to sleep well?”

There are 5 major factors that cause us sleep deprivation:

1. Constant light well into the night
2. Regularized temperature
3. Caffeine
4. Alcohol
5. Work schedule

#### Constant light:

* Our evolutionary marine origins mean that our brain is notoriously sensitive to blue light (since the ocean tends to filter our most of the other colours). This is why the proliferation of LEDs and blue light from screens etc. prolong our wake-time and eat into our sleep time. Blue light from iPads can block melatonin rise in the body by 23% on average.
* Even very minimal lighting by our bedside can suppress melatonin production. A lighting with 8–10 lux of power can suppress melatonin. Bedside lamps have 20–80 lux.
* In an experiment, reading on an iPad suppressed melatonin release by 50%. There were 3 more concerning impacts: a) Significant REM sleep was lost; b) Tiredness/sleepiness the next day; c) Melatonin rise didn’t bounce back after cessation. It took several days.
* Potential fix: Go for mood lighting as the evening winds down. Ensure complete darkness in the night. Install blue-light filters on your devices.

I’ve been a big fan of nice, bright white bulbs — but I did notice that if I spent my evening in my room, then it would take me longer to get to bed.

I’ve now switched to smart bulbs that can have different brightness levels, and set it to bright white in the mornings to wake me up, and have them dim as the evening starts.

#### Regularized Temperature:

* Body needs to be a few degrees cooler to get to sleep quicker because nocturnal melatonin levels are controlled by this (as well as light).
* Keeping your extremities (head, hands, legs) warm will help reduce core body temperature.
* Washing your face/legs or just having a nice shower before sleeping can also help the body reach the desired sleep temperature sooner
* The clothes you wear can also make your body warmer than desired. Consider sleeping in light, loose clothing, or even shirtless.
* Bedroom temperature around 65F or 18.3C is ideal for sleep

#### Caffeine:

* As mentioned above in the section about how we fall asleep, Caffeine blocks Adenosine from getting to it’s receptors and therefore lulling us to sleep.
* Caffeine can also take a significant amount of time to exit the system, so having coffee in the late afternoon/evening can delay onset of sleep further.
* Avoid coffee/caffeine late afternoon/evening.

#### Alcohol:

* Contrary to popular belief, alcohol doesn’t make you sleep better. It just sedates you. It is a sedative, which initially starts by sedating your prefrontal cortex (which makes you less logical/rational)
* It affects sleep in two important ways: a) Fragments sleep, which means you wake up in the night without it registering; b) It suppresses REM sleep by generating aldehydes, which prevents the brain from generating REM
* The REM suppression can result in a build up of REM sleep pressure. In extreme cases, this can cause REM sleep to encroach on wakefulness causing powerful hallucinations, delusions. Alcoholics experience this.
* Also, a drink after learning something can mean you don’t truly grasp what you’ve learned. This is due to the alcohol effect on REM. Even drinking a few days after learning can impair your understanding.
* Drink in the mornings :)

#### Work schedule:

* Regardless of when we go to sleep, we also have this thing called an alarm that wakes us up, thereby prematurely terminating sleep. We’re the only species on the planet that does this.
* Waking up from an alarm jolts the body into a fight/flight, and we see an increase in blood pressure, heart rate spike, associated chemicals as well. Snoozing and waking up again is you putting the body through this assault over and over again.
* Also, if your chronotype is such that you sleep late and rise late, the work schedule could be going against your very biology and depriving you of sleep that you need that way.
* Not much you can do to work around this as such given the way the world is. See if you can work for a company that allows you flexible work timings.

And if you have no option but to be sleep deprived: Take naps \*before\* you know you’re going to be sleep deprived. More effective in keeping you attentive than taking short naps in spurts during your sleep deprivation.

---

### On Insomnia

One of the things I really liked about the book, and that I believe is important that people understand, is what insomnia really is.

When someone does not provide themselves enough sleep opportunity (i.e. enough time in bed), but has the ability to generate sleep properly, this is **sleep deprivation**.

When someone provides themselves enough sleep opportunity (i.e. spend 8–9 hours in bed), but *cannot* generate sleep properly, this is **insomnia.**

So, for example, if you have to get to work at 9am, but find yourself in bed only at 3am for some reason, then you may want to try slipping into bed much earlier before calling yourself an insomniac.

Insomnia could be a result of stress, something physical, medical problems, aging, environmental issues (too much light, nicotine consumption). An overactive sympathetic nervous system can make it difficult for a body to generate sleep.

To see if you may be suffering from insomnia, see if you have experienced some/all of the following for several months:

1. Difficulty falling asleep
2. Waking up in the middle of the night
3. Waking up too early and have difficulty falling asleep after that
4. Feeling tired/groggy throughout the day

---

### A few other interesting things (a.k.a more reasons to buy and read the book)

All the above things are things that I believe are key takeaways for me, and perhaps people in my age group (mid-20s to early-30s) find relevant. But the book was a treasure trove of information aside from that as well.

Here are a few of them:

* There are huge changes in the way we sleep as we grow, from fetus to baby to adult to old age. Sleep plays a significant role in us especially while growing up. The book talks about why early school times for kids are dangerous and why they should be allowed to sleep late.
* Also talks about how when a baby kicks, it’s actually in REM sleep/dreaming. And why a mother shouldn’t drink during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* Aside from insomnia, Dr. Walker touches upon some other sleep disorders: sleep walking, narcolepsy, and the most what-the-fuck of them all: Fatal Familial Insomnia
* A strong word of caution to those who consume sleeping pills. You’ll want to know the deleterious effects of them. In short, sleeping pills don’t generate sleep either. Like alcohol, they just sedate you, and have dangerous side effects. The book also suggests alternatives.
* The author also talks about the impact of sleep on society — such as driving related accidents, school timings (as mentioned above) — and talks about a future world where we are able to harness our individual sleep information to great effect.
* There’s an entire subsection on dreams and dreaming that is mind-blowing. A research in Japan managed to figure out, to an extent, what \*exactly\* we’re dreaming about while we’re dreaming.
* How “Power naps” came to be a thing, and how it’s definition changed over time.
* Sleep in the animal kingdom and the curious behaviour of birds.
* How jet lag works.

And so much more about the nature of the experiments done to prove the results I’ve mentioned above.

Excellent read. Must read for anyone who takes their health seriously.
