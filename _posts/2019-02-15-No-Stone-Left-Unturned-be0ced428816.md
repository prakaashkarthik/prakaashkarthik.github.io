# No Stone Left Unturned

I just finished reading [“The Second Kind of Impossible”](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Kind-Impossible-Extraordinary-Matter/dp/1476729921) by Paul Steinhardt, a pioneer (if not *the* pioneer) in the field of Quasicrystal research. It was a wholesome account of the research that he and his various teams performed over the last three decades, the theories they sought to prove, the roadblocks they hit, the criticisms they faced, their concerns they held, the luck they received, and most importantly the grit, determination and persistence each and every one who worked on this project displayed.

If you take your average action movie, you’ll have your central protagonist who everyone is rooting for who will also inevitably find themselves in a situation there’s no way they can get out of unscathed. You’re on tenterhooks wondering what they’re going to do. You know they’re going to make it out alive — they *have* to — but you just don’t know *how.* Then in a single twist of fate/moment of brilliance, the protagonist survives and you can finally breathe again. This book reads just like that, what with the non-linear story telling, the epiphanies, the will-he-won’t-he moments. I can easily see this get Hollywood-ized.

---

The book itself is divided into 3 sections in which Paul Steinhardt goes into details of a journey that spanned 30 years (and is still ongoing).

You can see how the book’s editorial team were preparing the Hollywood script after reading the Preface itself, where the protagonist finds himself in the middle of nowhere in Far Eastern Russia, wondering what he was doing there. He’s a theoretical physicist after all. And he’s got a story to tell.

The first part of the book sets the scene in Pasadena, CA, where after an as-yet-unexplained demonstration by our hero (Dr. Steinhardt) in the hallowed halls of Caltech, his mentor — none other than Dr. Richard Feynman — walks up to him, asks to see it again, and exclaims, “Impossible!”.

We then go into a flashback set in Paris in the late 18th Century, where the idea of crystals was born. With this flashback, the book establishes with the reader the idea of crystals, how they’re structured, and the assumption (which established itself as fundamental principle) in Physics that all minerals will comprise of crystals arranged in one of five possible patterns. What Dr. Steinhardt’s demonstration showed was that this *wasn’t* the case, much to the surprise of Dr. Feynman and millions of others around the world.

He then talks about how it all started with a question: “What happens when a liquid is cooled so rapidly that it solidifies before giving atoms a chance to arrange themselves into crystals?” and that one particular computer experiment that attempted to provide an estimate of the atomic bond arrangement seemed to think the most likely solution was a forbidden one (according to the laws of Crystallography).

The story then takes off from there into a world of puzzles and patterns, most notably the [Penrose tiling,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling) and how Paul Steinhardt and his student were finding out rules that, in theory, made these atomic arrangements that were “forbidden” actually possible. Meanwhile, in a lab a few hours away from Dr. Steinhardt’s, Dr. Dan Shechtman just found himself staring through a microscope, famously scribbling into a notepad: “10 fold ????” . Unbeknownst to each other, one lab had established the theoretical possibility for a forbidden arrangement of atoms, and one lab had experimental proof of it!

The fundamental building blocks of minerals in which the atoms arranged themselves in such a forbidden manner came to be known as Quasicrystals. Dr. Dan Shechtman would also go on to win the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of Quasicrystals.

If you’re a sucker for moments like that, then you’ll lap up what comes next — the Battle of the Theories. Obviously, once there was evidence of quasicrystals, the protagonist wasn’t going to be the only one with an inkling of how they came to be. So our hero finds himself in a scientific battle to the death with the heavyweights of the Physics world. There could only be one winner…

When the second part of the book starts, in the late 1980s, creating synthetic quasicrystals in the lab was no longer a big deal. The question then became: “Are there any examples of quasicrystals *in nature*?”. Dr. Steinhardt starts down a path that would lead him on quite an adventure.

A chance discovery of a mineral in a museum in Florence would lead Dr. Steinhardt and Italian geologist Luca Bindi (the second hero of the book according to me) to believe that quasicrystals did indeed occur in nature. The only problem was that they had exactly one sample.

When a couple of the world’s leading mineral experts, who were also the biggest skeptics of the “natural quasicrystal” idea, agreed to test the sample, it would seem that the skeptics were right all along. Right up until a secret diary kept by an old woman in Amsterdam provided clues about the provenance of the sample. If only there were more samples with more quasicrystals in them!

And that leads us to the third part of the book, most of which is set in the Tundra of East Russia, where — if you remember — the Preface of the book started. A 61-year old theoretical physicist finds himself suffocated by mosquitoes in the middle of nowhere, wondering where is dear son is…

I’m going to leave it there. Hopefully that “trailer” captures enough of your imagination that you’ll want to read the book yourself. As I was reading the book though, there were a few things that really struck me.

One of them was the prime importance of one’s reputation in the world of Science and academia. There were multiple occasions where Dr. Steinhardt was faced with a decision that could’ve harmed his reputation, and in the way he describes it you can infer how much this meant to him.

It wasn’t just that though. There were also cases where other scientists/academicians would either vouch for him or oppose him, and cases where Dr. Steinhardt explained that if a certain scientist didn’t agree with his ideas (or thought his quest would ultimately be futile), it would set his standing in the scientific world back significantly.

I find that quite odd. Science requires bravery, because you’re going to dedicate the best years of your life on an open-ended question. I also think its a field where experiencing failure is quite common. So to instill a fear of failing or being wrong in scientists, and being punished for it, seems counterproductive to me. I guess on the one hand it forces one to maintain high quality of work, but on the other hand it seems antithetical to the spirit of science.

In the face of all that, I also admire Dr. Steinhardt for the way he approached making those decisions: in a logical, rational manner. He didn’t let his emotions get the better of him, and he was confident in the research he’d done.

And where did that confidence stem from? From the fact that during his research, he ensured there was *no stone left unturned*. If there’s one lesson I take away from this book, it is this: if it is in your work ethic to pursue the truth, remain undeterred by obstacles, and leave no stone unturned in this pursuit, you will have the confidence to make tough decisions and take big risks. These decisions and risks will ultimately lead you to success.

To be obsessed about something and to also possess the grit and determination to see it to its end is a power that not many have. The key is in taming that power and deploying it at will. Those who have a natural ability to do that are truly gifted.

30 years were spent working on this problem. It wasn’t Steinhardt’s “day job” when he started out, nor was it the “day job” of those who collaborated with him. To spend 30 years in pursuit of the truth, and not rest on one’s laurels, is a testament to this man and his team’s passion, spirit, grit, determination and ethos. It also goes to show that good things take time and cannot/should not be rushed.

Perhaps on the lines of “making one’s own luck”, Paul Steinhardt recalls something he learned from Dr. Richard Feynman in relation to how he got started down the path of quasicrystals:

> “It is wise to follow your heart and seek out good problems wherever they may lead, even if it is not in the direction you thought you were supposed to be headed”

For Paul Steinhardt was primarily as cosmologist who pioneered multiple competing theories to the Big Bang on the origins of the universe. As mentioned in the first section of his book, he simply came across a good problem (rapid cooling of liquids) and followed the thread from there. For his efforts, he now has a mineral named after him — Steinhardtite. Not bad eh?

And of course, finally, the motif of the book — the title: “The Second Kind of Impossible”.

It was *impossible* for minerals to be formed from crystals that didn’t have one of five possible patterns.

It was *impossible* for there to be naturally occurring quasicrystals.

Just like Feynman had exclaimed at the end of the author’s demonstration of quasicrystals at Caltech, the book seemed to be filled with things that were *impossible.*

But which kind of “impossible” was it?

> “Do you mean impossible like 1 + 1 = 3? Or do you mean very, very unlikely? And if true, very, very interesting?”
