# Culture of Management

I currently work for a very prominent technology company. A company that used to be synonymous with Silicon Valley and for pioneering leading edge technologies that made the age of the computer possible. The darling of Wall Street in the 80s and 90s. A benchmark company for business cases. 

Andy Grove's company. 

A company that's now in turmoil - pilloried by the media and the stock market, accused of having a 'cultural rot'. A company whose employees are wondering how to fix this and get back to its glory days. 

A company that is no longer Andy Grove's - just Intel. 

I find myself a cog in this behemoth, wondering what role I can play to turn things around. There are still so many, many people at this company who worked back in the good old days - when Andy ran it and for the next ~10-15 years when we were still the semiconductor leaders - who say, "bring back the Groveian culture". Disciplined Execution. Constructive Confrontation. "That's the key", they say. 

And so I turn towards his instructive 'High Output Management' - a book he addressed to people like me: cogs in corporate machines - to understand Grovein culture, contemplate its applications to my day-to-day, identify how I can translate it into maximum output for Intel today.

## Reflections on reading High Output Management

### Introduction
He makes so many killer statements/observations even in his introduction section where he reflects on the changes that have happened since his book was published. He brings up email and globalization as big changes. 

    "If products and services become indistinguishable, all there is by the way of competitive advantage is _time_". 

Andy Grove stated this in the context of email becoming ubiquitous in the workplace, which would outpace anyone still relying on word-of-mouth to spread official communication. If email wasn't going to be adopted hastily, then you'd lose your competitive edge. 
I feel like there are many implications of this, especially in today's world of AI and LLMs. 

Over the last decade, Intel's major setbacks have come partly because of "missing the bus" on various opportunities - mobile processors, discrete graphics, now XPUs - but also because we couldn't execute our bread-and-butter on time. Delay after delay on delivering Server products. Not only could we not deliver early - we couldn't deliver on any schedule we promised (although this is largely being remedied). 

There is such a hunger for leading edge chips today. At a time when we need to be fighting with our competitors to be first through the customer's door with a ready rack-scale design, out-of-the-box fine-tuned SW for AI training and/or inference, we don't even have a product. How do we fix this? 

Many companies around the world are adopting AI/LLMs into their daily workflows. If we don't figure out how to quickly adopt this efficiently for our workflows, there is no way for us to be predictable or deliver early. Competitors are already training their codebases for their employees to use. We have to make use of AI at work.
