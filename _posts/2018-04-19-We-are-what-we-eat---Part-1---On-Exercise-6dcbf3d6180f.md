Through this post, I want to talk about the fundamentals of how our muscles work in order to imbibe mental models that can be used to evaluate our exercise regimen and associated dietary choices.

#### What is ‘exercise’? Why do it?

Exercise is essentially a conditioning of the body, where we perform physical activities that put the body under some physical stress in order to be able to withstand that amount of stress going forward.

When we exercise, there is a breakdown of muscle tissue (called ‘catabolism’). But after that, the body needs to build up the muscle again (called ‘anabolism’) since, by exercising, you’ve told the body that you need to use those muscles. These anabolic processes increase your muscle tissue and your bone density and will try to ensure that your body can withstand the previous stresses it was subject to, hence making you stronger.

Coincidentally, muscle tissue and bone density are among the major things that degrade when we age. So you could say exercising reverses your aging process. That alone is a pretty good reason to exercise.

Now, I’m not going to extol the virtues of exercising here. You can get that information from any health website. But I do want to give a special mention to the fact that exercise also helps bring about hormonal balance in the body. Of note, they help regulate insulin, thyroid, testosterone/estrogen, and cortisol, all of which are imperative for proper functioning of the body and the mind.

#### A bit about Muscles

There are a couple of things I’d like to write about here that I feel is relevant background information. First is on how muscles work at a microscopic level, and the second is about the biochemistry involved in muscle operation. *This part is going to read like a science lesson, so skip on to the next section if it doesn’t interest you.*

In general, the way muscles operate is through contractions and relaxations which are facilitated by chemical reactions between proteins. The accepted model for the working of muscles is called the Cross-Bridge Muscle Contraction Cycle.

Indelicately speaking, this is what happens in that cycle: Within the smallest unit of our muscles (called the Sarcomere), there exist microfilaments of 2 proteins called Myosin and Actin. The contractions are produced by parts of Myosin grabbing hold of (or binding to) the Actin filament and pulling it, and the relaxation is caused by Myosin letting go of the Actin filament.

The actions of binding and letting go are in turn influenced by ATP (Adenosine Tri-Phosphate) and Calcium. The Calcium opens up a spot for the Myosin to grab hold of the Actin, and ATP gives Myosin the energy to be able to grab that spot and bind to the Actin.

Visually, it looks like this:

Clearly there’s a little more nuance to this than what I’ve described (and a good link to learn about all that is [here](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-biology/chapter/muscle-contraction-and-locomotion/)). But this is where I started asking the question of how ATP gets released to the muscle cells for consumption.

Say hello to your friends, the Mitochondria. Mitochondria are a part of cells (not just muscle cells), and their function is to produce energy for the cell to use up. This energy is in the form of ATP molecules, which store energy in it’s structure in the form of a chemical bond. Typical cells have one mitochondrion, but muscle cells have many since they need a lot of ATP for their functioning.

So when we say ‘ATP gives Myosin the energy’, what happens is that the Adenosine Tri-Phosphate breaks up into Adenosine Di-Phosphate (ADP) and Phosphate through a process called hydrolysis. The breaking of that chemical bond is what releases the energy that the Myosin consumes.

How do the mitochondria generate ATP? Through multiple mechanisms, actually. There’s the Krebs cycle (or citric acid cycle), fatty acid oxidation, and amino acid oxidation. These are complex processes that I have to admit I have limited understanding of, but at a high-level, the carbohydrates/fats/proteins in our body get broken down and the products of these reactions make their way into the mitochondria. Here, they react with oxygen through a process called aerobic cellular respiration and produce ATP. They can also produce ATP through anaerobic cellular respiration (or fermentation), but it doesn’t yield as much quantity as in aerobic respiration.

(Side note: As I was reading all this, I remembered I’d actually studied all of this in high school Biology in some detail. Clearly didn’t stick with me. Starting with “[Carbohydrate Catabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_catabolism)” on Wikipedia and following the links is how I read up on this)

#### Energy Systems

So now we’ve established how muscles work (chemical reactions that result in contractions), why they need energy (ATP), and where they get this ATP from. Now the question is how to fit this information in the bigger picture of our day-to-day muscle usage. This is where the energy systems come in.

There are 2 types of muscles which are called oxidative and non-oxidative fibers. Or red and white fibers. Or Slow Twitch and Fast Twitch fibers. Or just simply Type 1 and Type 2. Within Type 2, there are 2 categories (Types 2a or Fast Oxidative and 2b or Fast Glycolytic)

When we talk about energy systems, the body basically has three:

1. The Aerobic system
2. The Glycogen-Lactic Acid system (Anaerobic)
3. The ATP-CP system (Anaerobic). CP stands for Creatine Phosphate. It’s also called ATP-PC (for Phosphocreatine)

The activity that you perform determines what sort of muscles you’re going to be employing, and that determines which energy system is being employed — for the most part — to provide the required ATP for the activity. I say ‘for the most part’ because at any point in time all three are in use. The one that dominates depends on the intensity of that activity.

Let me summarize this in the form of a table. Note: it’s important to understand that the Activity decides the Muscle type employed, which decides the Energy system used, which determines how ATP is produced and therefore what it uses to produce that ATP. So you can think of it as the item in the left columns lead to the items in the right columns.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*dYVzH6Avj9gU-0j8TaRwpg.png)

Tying this information back into what we learned about the Mitochondria:

* Type 1 muscles have a lot of mitochondria because they need sustained energy output. They get enough oxygen during the muscle employment and there’s a steady stream of ATP available. The reason they’re slow in contraction is because they don’t hydrolyze the ATP to produce energy fast enough. They’re also smaller in diameter, so don’t produce as much tension.
* When your muscles are employed to do quick actions, sometimes there just isn’t enough time for oxygen to get to your muscle and work it’s magic. So the energy has to be obtained in it’s absence. This is the case for Type 2 muscles.
* Type 2a muscles don’t have as much mitochondria, but they still have some. They’re larger in diameter than Type 1, and can produce ATP quick enough for fast movements and strong tension.
* Type 2b have very little mitochondria because they don’t really need them. They kind of just use up existing ATP, CP, and if they need to produce ATP they do so in small amounts through breakdown of glycogen fermentation. But that isn’t sustainable, so these muscles get fatigued quite easily.

It’s obvious that if we were to just go about our daily lives without making time for some sort of intense physical activity, there are a huge section of muscles that won’t get used regularly. As we age, the natural tendency is for these muscles to atrophy due to wear and tear. Combine that with the fact that muscles can also be broken down for energy (and as it turns out it is a lot easier for the body to get energy from muscles than from fat), if we don’t use them we lose them.

#### During and After Exercise

At this point, we’ve established the types of muscles we use, the situations where we use them, how they operate, and what happens when we don’t use them. So what happens when we \*do\* exercise our muscles?

Broadly speaking, you can categorize exercises under strength training or cardio.

* Strength training is “the use of some sort of resistance to induce muscular contraction to build strength, anaerobic endurance, size of skeletal muscles” (the quotes are because I lifted that straight from my source [2]).
* Cardio is a training of the Cardio-Respiratory system where we do aerobic exercises that get the heart rate up and exercise the body’s ability to get the required Oxygen to the rest of the body in order to keep us going.

**When you do strength training,** you’re training your muscles to withstand more and more pressure.

* Typically you’ll achieve this by doing exercises with dumbbells, barbells, or by adding weight to your normal body weight when doing just body-weight exercises (like push ups or planks).
* When you do lift these weights, you will be calling your Type 2 muscles into action — which means anaerobic energy system for the most part — and hence using up carbohydrates from your body as fuel. At some point, you’ll likely also be using the aerobic energy system and will also burn fat, but mostly it’s carbs.
* In terms of calories burned during a strength/weight training session, you probably don’t burn much. But what happens is that after all the anaerobic respiration, your body needs a lot of oxygen to restore itself to its resting state and to repair the muscles — called an oxygen debt, or “after-burn”.
* This after-burn results from a) the need to replenish ATP-CP reserves in the body, and is met soon after the exercise stops, and b) the need to remove the Lactic acid produced by the anaerobic energy system, bring down body temperature, restore glycogen stores, and repair the body. This can take 24–48 hours.
* The body reparation — aka anabolism — is what causes your muscles to grow back stronger in order to resist the weight/stress it was just exposed to. This is what makes you stronger as well.
* Also, this after-burn happens while your body is at rest — so you get free calorie burning while doing nothing.

**When you do cardio training,** the body is using it’s muscles continuously and calls into action the aerobic energy system.

* This stresses your body’s ability to pump blood and extract oxygen from it to produce energy. The body’s ability to do so is measured by your body’s max VO2, or maximum volume of oxygen consumed during exercise.
* When you increase the intensity of these exercises, you may incorporate your Type 2 muscles — the byproduct of which is lactic acid. The point at which this happens is called your lactate threshold (LT). Lactic acid in your system means the muscles fatigue quicker.
* Strengthening your muscles means you can push back your LT, which means your endurance goes up.
* It’s important to note that when you use the aerobic energy pathways, you initially start by burning carbs. But after a point, you start burning fat (refer to the aerobic energy system’s raw materials above). Since fat is richer source of energy, you may actually be able to feel your body make this transition.
* For example, when you start to run you may feel laboured, but after a few minutes it becomes a lot easier. The point where it becomes easier is the point of transition.
* Post-exercise you don’t really burn calories like you would after strength training, because you don’t rake up much of an oxygen debt as you did during strength training.

Both types of training complement each other. If your focus is on losing fat mass, then it is absolutely imperative that you dedicate time to strength training before taking up cardio exercises.

Why?

This is due to something called ‘glycogen sparing’. During strength training, carbs in the form of glycogen are the major raw material required for energy production. If the body is trained enough, it may decide that the glycogen reserves in the body are required more for strength training and are too precious to use up during your cardio/aerobic activities. So it’ll start using up fats directly. This will result in more fat loss than if you were just doing cardio.

Also, to do cardio exercises, you do need to have strong tendons, bones, ligaments, joints — or else you’ll be prone to injuries, which will lead to irregular exercise. You can strengthen those during weight training.

A wholesome exercise routine will increase your cardio-respiratory fitness, your muscular strength, your muscular endurance, and your flexibility. So if you plan your exercise routine accordingly, and execute to it, then as all these parameters change favorably your body will too.

Overall, a good exercise routine will reduce risk of diabetes (since it increases glucose uptake by muscle cells and brings down blood sugar levels. For diabetics, it’s shown to be more effective than hypoglycaemic drugs), heart disease, reduce blood pressure, improve kidney functionality, increase sex drive, reduce bad cholesterol and increase good cholesterol, improve your general metabolism, regulate hormones, and practically reverse aging.

#### What’s this got to do with food?

Food is important here for at least the following reasons:

1. **What we eat determines what gets used up as fuel:**

From the sections above, we know that the preferred fuel source for our muscles is glycogen (carbohydrates), followed by fats and protein. So the importance of a wholesome diet should be fairly obvious now.

Glycogen is needed to get the momentum going no matter what exercise you’re doing. Without it, we can’t get a good workout in. We’ll be tired, fatigued, and hating on life. And once used up, glycogen apparently takes [some time](http://thesportjournal.org/article/glycogen-replenishment-after-exhaustive-exercise/) to replenish.

People who’ve spent time studying the body recommend we have a fruit (an apple or a banana) as pre-workout, as late as 15–20 minutes before the workout. The idea is to have something to eat before the workout but not have a good amount of food in the stomach, since that restricts blood flow to the muscles. Since protein isn’t easy to digest, having a lot of protein before the workout may hamper your workout as well.

Another important rule of thumb is that in order to burn fat, you need to eat fat. Now, there are good fats (saturated and unsaturated fats) and bad fats (trans fats) — so make sure you avoid the latter. But in order for glycogen sparing to take place, as in during cardio workouts, you need to have free fatty acids (FFAs) in the blood stream. FFAs in the blood stream encourages the body to also break down the fat stored in fat cells into FFAs and use that up as energy. Things like ghee, butter, coconut help here.

It’s also important to remember that the body needs energy for all it’s functions (obviously), even clacking away on a computer keyboard. So it’s important to have a wholesome diet that has carbohydrates and fats in it.

2. **What we eat determines how we recover post-exercise:**

There’s a lot happening in our body post-exercise.

* There are metabolic processes happening, by-products of which are unstable molecules in the body (free radicals) that have the potential to cause cellular damage and reverse some of the good done by exercise.

To get rid of these free radicals, anti-oxidants are the best options. In general, foods with Vitamins C, E, A, or minerals like zinc, selenium, chromium are your best bet. Zinc, selenium, chromium also make insulin more efficient.

* Our [cortisol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol) and insulin levels are high. Cortisol’s responsibility is to aid metabolism of carbs, fats, proteins in order to provide energy for the working muscle group — which is exactly what we need for a good workout. Cortisol generally gets released in fight-or-flight scenarios, so also finds its way into our bloodstream at stressful times. Unfortunately, Cortisol does its job by increasing blood sugar, suppressing the immune system. So aside from aiding our muscles, Cortisol is [quite evil](https://idmprogram.com/closer-look-cortisol-hormonal-obesity-xxxx/).

Reducing our Cortisol levels post-workout is imperative. Since our body is in a sugar-depleted state post-exercise, our body may try to increase blood sugar by pumping out Cortisol. So it’s important to replenish that as soon as possible after exercise. So right after the workout, you can have a banana, and then have a post-exercise meal that’s good plenty of carbs, fats, protein, water.

Excessive Cortisol can eventually lead to insulin insensitivity which leads to obesity, diabetes. In terms foods that can reduce cortisol levels, fruits with Vitamin C, Omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil supplements, and [Ashwagandha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withania_somnifera) are good options.

To summarize, in the words of my primary source ([2]), there are 4 Rs to follow post-exercise: Rehydrate (drink lots of water), Replenish (your glycogen), Repair (your muscles and tissues by having a protein shake), Recover (reduce free-radicals in the body to ensure optimal recovery). And overall, have a wholesome diet.

#### Summary

To be honest, there is quite a lot of content there. I can imagine not everyone will be inclined to read through something that starts to read like a textbook. So here are what I believe are key points:

* Exercise is the closest thing we have to a miracle cure/panacea/fountain of youth. It strengthens our voluntary and involuntary muscles, regulates hormones.
* There are roughly 2 categories of exercise — strength training (with weights) and cardio (running and such). They achieve different things and complement each other. Do both — ideally cardio on the day after strength training.
* Muscles operate because of Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP), and there are a bunch of ways our body generates ATP
* There are 3 types of muscles which operate under different levels of intensity. Owing to that they produce the ATP they need in different ways.
* Weight/strength training uses the type of muscles that produce ATP in the absence of oxygen, and uses carbs as the main source of fuel. By-products of this result in the body needing more oxygen post-workout, and will result in calorie burning up to 48 hours after workout. This is called after-burn.
* Cardio uses type of muscle that produces ATP in the presence of oxygen, and which uses carbs, fats, proteins (in that order) for this production. If you combine with weight training, your body will tend to spare the carbs for weight training and focus on burning fats (called glycogen sparing).
* Eat light before your workout, preferably a fruit. Ensures there’s ready fuel in the bloodstream, and not having a full stomach means blood circulation to muscles isn’t inhibited. Ensure your diet also has dietary fat, as having dietary fat can help breakdown more fat during cardio workouts.
* Rehydrate, Replenish, Repair, Recover. Do what you can to reduce cortisol levels and free radicals in the body after exercise. Primarily means have fruits, anti-oxidants, and minerals (Zinc, Selenium, Chromium).
* Ensure your diet is wholesome.
